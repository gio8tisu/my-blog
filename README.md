# Heroku Docker deploy
After GitHub action has been successfully completed (image pushed to Docker Hub), pull the image:
```
$ docker pull gio8tisu/strapi-blog:master
```
To push an image to Heroku, such as one pulled from Docker Hub, tag it and push it according to this naming template:
```
$ docker tag gio8tisu/strapi-blog:master registry.heroku.com/strapi-campderrich/web
$ docker push registry.heroku.com/strapi-campderrich/web
```
After youâ€™ve successfully pushed an image to Container Registry, you can create a new release using:
```
$ heroku container:release -a strapi-campderrich web
```
